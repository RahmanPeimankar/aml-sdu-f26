# Please Follow the Instruction Below to Run the Notebooks

On this page, you can find course materials such as slides and Jupyter notebooks.

You only need to launch Colab by clicking on the above logo. This will basically setup the environment that you need to run the Jupyter notebooks on the cloud. This may take a few minutes. So, grab a cup of coffee 😊.
